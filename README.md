Kubernetes configuration for elasticsearch cluster



#### Follow me on [![alt text][1.1]][1]

### Usage

1. Create elasticsearch master pod which has elasticsearch-master container.

```
    $kubectl create -f es-master.yml
```

2. Create K8s service resource named elasticsearch with external cloud provider Loadbalancer. This is not recommented for the production. You can use this to test indices in the elaticsearch and the node status.  

```
    $kubectl create -f es-master-svc.yml
```

3. Create the slave node to include in the cluster. Check the status of the master and slave node with the help of following url.

```
    http://< serverip >:9200/_cat/nodes
```


4. Create a Deployment resource named elasticsearch-client with container named elasticsearch-client. This will be added as a slave node
   in the cluster. 

```
    kubectl create -f es-client.yml
```

5. Create a K8s service named elastic-discovery with port 9300 port for syncing the cluster 

```
   kubectl create -f es-master-client-svc.yml
```

6. Create a service named elasticsearch-internal, so that services can make use of elasticsearch cluster. This service is not exposing to the outside world .

```
    kubectl create -f es-master-internal-svc.yml
```

 7. This will create a pod to store data in the elasticsearch cluster with the help of Statefulsets kubernetes resource. 
 
```
    kubectl create -f es-date-statefulset.yml
```
